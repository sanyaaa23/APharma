# Disease Classifier Based on Symptoms

## Introduction
The Disease Classifier Based on Symptoms is a machine learning-based application designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases efficiently and accurately based on symptoms and patient data. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to predict diseases using patient records, medical history, and lab results.
This AI-powered system can help streamline diagnostic processes, reduce human error, and improve healthcare outcomes by automating disease classification. The model uses extensive datasets covering multiple diseases, enabling it to provide reliable and accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes decision trees, logistic regression, neural networks, and support vector machines.
- **Comprehensive Datasets**: Uses diverse datasets covering diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory conditions.
- **Automated Data Processing**: Preprocessing scripts for handling medical records, demographic data, lab results, and imaging data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies disease classification for non-technical users.
- **Open Source**: The repository provides sample code, documentation, and tutorials to assist users.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Frameworks**: Flask (if deploying as a web app), Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Storage**: CSV/JSON files for structured datasets

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the notebook.
2. Train the machine learning models using the provided scripts.
3. Input patient symptoms and get predictions.
4. Visualize model performance with evaluation metrics.

## Model Training
The disease classification models are trained on labeled datasets, with features including:
- **Symptoms**
- **Demographics**
- **Lab Results**
- **Medical History**

The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
