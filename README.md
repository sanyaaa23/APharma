# Disease Classifier Based on Symptoms

## Introduction
The Disease Classifier Based on Symptoms is a machine learning-based application designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases efficiently and accurately based on symptoms and patient data. This project leverages various machine learning algorithms to predict diseases using patient records, medical history, and lab results.
This AI-powered system can help streamline diagnostic processes, reduce human error, and improve healthcare outcomes by automating disease classification. The model uses extensive datasets covering multiple diseases, enabling it to provide reliable and accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements multiple algorithms, including:
  - Decision Trees
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Na√Øve Bayes
- **Comprehensive Datasets**: Utilizes structured datasets containing:
  - Symptoms
  - Patient demographic information
  - Lab test results
  - Disease labels (Prognosis)
- **Automated Data Processing**:
  - Handles missing values
  - Encodes categorical data
  - Splits dataset into training and testing sets
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Symptom distribution plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy score
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report
- **Open Source & Extensible**: The repository includes code, datasets, and documentation to help users extend and modify the project.
